# CameoParison

I made this project to improve myself at Svelte. This project includes Svelte. original version of the [FrontendMasters](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/cameoparison-starter/tree/complete)

### You can look at original version of project made by [FrontendMasters - Rich Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/cameoparison-starter/tree/complete)

## Live Demo

You can look at project demo in [here]().

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
